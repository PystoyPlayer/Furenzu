Some of his early portraits show the sitters grouped in a landscape (Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, c. 1750). As he became famous and his sitters fashionable, he adopted a more formal manner that owed something to Anthony Van Duck (The Blue Boy, c. 1770). His landscapes are of idyllic scenes. During his last years he also painted seascapes and idealized full-size pictures of rustics and country children.","targetRectangle":{"y":312.38231754302979,"x":103.65928649902344,"width":1079.0500000000002,"height":658.60000610351562}},{"text":"Thomas Gainsborough","targetRectangle":{"y":49.491442441940308,"x":353.28399658203125,"width":1212.4320009852647,"height":137.63519287109375}},{"text":"Thomas_Gainsborough_by_Thomas_Gainsborough.jpg","targetRectangle":{"y":311.1192626953125,"x":1347.66259765625,"width":472.65625,"height":574.40625}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00035007912466775983,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"E0862F7C6DA29DB95FAAEBCDD67D1B0A"}]}]}}]}} )
